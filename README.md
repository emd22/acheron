# c3d
A simple 3d game engine written in C. This is mainly a learning tool,
 but I hope to eventually get it to the point of being a working game!
### Requirements
- CMake
- SDL2 (`SDL2-devel` or `libSDL2-dev`)
- GLEW (`glew-devel` or `libglew-dev`)

### To do
- [ ] Replace all old GLU function calls with custom math functions
- [ ] Replace OpenGL 2.x calls with much better OpenGL 3 ones
- [ ] Implement model loading from files
- [ ] Implement simple lighting and shading
